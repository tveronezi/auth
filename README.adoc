== Whats in the box?

=== `/jwt-auth` and `/jwt-auth-docker`

`/jwt-auth` is a nodejs restful application used by the system as JWT provider.

It exposes two endpoints: `POST /auth` and `GET /publickey`.

The first endpoint is used by the `/api` application (here: `api/src/main/java/todo/api/ApiAuth.java`) whenever the user
tries to authenticate.

`/jwt-auth-docker` wraps the application above on it's own docker image.
